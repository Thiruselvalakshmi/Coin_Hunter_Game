# Coin_Hunter_Game
A simple python based coin hunting game
This game involves the collection of coins in a sea where the coins will be dropped one by one.
To provide some interesting challenge feature I included a feature of adding lifes.
There will be three lifes/chances provided for the player.
Whenever the player misses to catch a coin a chance will be reduced.
Once all the chances get exhausted the game ends.
For collecting the coin we can move the girl left and right using the "Left" and "Right" arrows.
